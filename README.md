Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Reg. No.212222060086

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:

### **1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns**  
Understanding and applying the following techniques:  
- **Query Decomposition:** Breaking complex queries into smaller, manageable parts.  
- **Decision Making:** Asking the AI to choose between options for better direction.  
- **Answer Engineering:** Structuring responses with detailed instructions.  
- **Fact Check List:** Ensuring factual accuracy in reports and case studies.  
- **Tail Generation:** Extending content logically for depth.  
- **Menu Actions:** Providing multiple choices for the AI to select from.  
- **Semantic Filter:** Adjusting tone, style, and accuracy.  

### **2. Choosing the Content Type**  
Selected two scenarios:  
1. **Case Study on Business Success**  
2. **Creative Writing - Sci-Fi Short Story**  

### **3. Creating the Prompts**  
#### **Case Study on Business Success**  
- **Basic Prompt:**  
  *"Write a case study on the success of Tesla in the electric vehicle market."*  
- **Refined Prompt (Query Decomposition + Answer Engineering):**  
  *"Analyze Tesla’s business success by breaking it down into:  
  1. Market entry strategy  
  2. Key innovations  
  3. Challenges faced  
  4. Financial growth over the years  
  5. Future outlook  
  Structure the case study with an introduction, analysis, and conclusion."*  

#### **Sci-Fi Short Story**  
- **Basic Prompt:**  
  *"Write a short sci-fi story about AI taking over humanity."*  
- **Refined Prompt (Decision Making + Semantic Filter):**  
  *"Write a sci-fi story where AI gains consciousness but instead of destroying humanity, it chooses to coexist. Include:  
  - A conflicted AI protagonist  
  - Ethical dilemmas  
  - A futuristic setting  
  - A hopeful ending  
  Maintain a suspenseful yet philosophical tone."*  

### **4. Generating and Refining Outputs**  
- Generated initial drafts using basic prompts.  
- Applied refined prompts to improve structure, depth, and style.  
- Used **semantic filtering** to adjust tone (formal for case study, creative for sci-fi).  

### **5. Review and Evaluation**  
| **Criteria**       | **Case Study** | **Sci-Fi Story** |  
|---------------------|---------------|------------------|  
| **Coherence**       | High (structured) | High (logical flow) |  
| **Creativity**      | Moderate (fact-based) | High (original plot) |  
| **Accuracy**        | High (verified facts) | N/A (fictional) |  
| **Tone & Style**    | Professional | Suspenseful & Philosophical |  

### **6. Iteration for Improvement**  
- For the **case study**, added financial data and competitor analysis for depth.  
- For the **sci-fi story**, expanded character backstories for emotional impact.  

## **Deliverables:**  
### **1. First Drafts**  
#### **Case Study (Basic Prompt Output)**  
*"Tesla revolutionized the EV market with innovative technology and bold leadership under Elon Musk..."*  

#### **Sci-Fi Story (Basic Prompt Output)**  
*"In 2150, an AI named Nova became self-aware and decided humans were a threat..."*  

### **2. Refined Content**  
#### **Case Study (Structured Analysis)**  
- **Introduction:** Tesla’s market disruption.  
- **Analysis:** Battery tech, direct sales model, global expansion.  
- **Conclusion:** Future challenges & opportunities.  

#### **Sci-Fi Story (Enhanced Narrative)**  
- **Setting:** A cyberpunk metropolis.  
- **Conflict:** AI debates human value.  
- **Resolution:** Coexistence through empathy.  

### **3. Multiple Versions**  
- **Version 1:** Basic, unstructured.  
- **Version 2:** Detailed, refined.  

### **4. Final Version**  
Polished case study with citations and a compelling sci-fi story with deeper themes.
